# B-Wang-Korumilli-DeWitt

`Index.html` contains a visualization of BPS survey data that allows teachers to explore curriculum used elsewhere in the school district.

# Visualization Information

This visualization is currently (mostly) static and displays information only for the 'math' subject area.  The dropdowns will eventually be used to sort by subject or grade level data.
