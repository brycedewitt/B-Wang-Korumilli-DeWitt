An example is the music - which is a large part of songs, word play and letters . We are not given the resources to provide for our classroom so if a teacher want it they have to pay for it out of their own pocket.Also the curriculum requires two full time people in the classroom and time for those professionals to work and plan together.

As is, EL only provides superficial recommendations of how to best modify the curriculum for these learners and is impossible to teach with fidelity in classrooms with a wide range of student abilities without SIGNIFICANT modifications. There are times when it feels like I should just write my own curriculum instead of re-writing EL lessons.

I have no problem copying materials, but I find it absolutely awful that some of the materials are not even able to be printed clearly.Many of the readings have fonts and overall copy quality that is blurry and difficult to read.To me, I feel our students deserve much better than this.Other issues I have include the lack of quality texts for the whole class to engage with and read.From a district-wide view, I wonder if there have been gains in reading levels or MCAS performance (although this has been a \"moving target\" the last few years). While it is well-intended, I wonder if EL is the best curriculum for a large school district and the best to ensure that students have access to skills and practices to help them achieve.",

The Units of Study for Teaching Reading came out in 2016 and many are still familiar with the older versions of Reading and Writing Workshop which wasn't aligned to the Common Core. These units allow a balance of time spent with complex, grade level text and instructionally leveled texts. Research tells us that readers need time to READ in order to improve. Our old curricula did not allow for this opportunity as students spent most of their time filling in worksheets or graphic organizers rather than engaging in reading. Research also shows us that proficient readers spend up to 60 minutes per day reading while struggling readers spend 8 minutes or less reading. Many of our readers are struggling readers and by providing them with a curriculum that requires them to spend most of their ELA block filling in graphic organizers that they aren't able to recreate on MCAS or other real- life reading experiences, we further their lack of access to the one thing that's been proven to move children to become proficient readers- READING.",

Laminating is also at teachers expense.The new writing portion is very challenging for teachers and students (I understand it is in the pilot stage).There is no guided reading included so for schools that do not have big guided reading libraries-this is problematic. Shared reading depends on printing out and enlarging poems...no big books have been provided for shared reading.",

The topics are not all that interesting and relatable to the population I work with. There is also no leeway within the lessons for teachers to engage the students in related topics or skills because it is so scripted that if you skip or modify a lesson it could potentially ruin future lessons. EL also does not account for the teaching of basic skills- it assumes that students have certain basic, higher order thinking skills already and that there is no need to reinforce or teach those schools within the lessons. It does not account for ELL's or special needs and the few suggestions that they do provide are not nearly enough. Finally, the skills that they do practice are done in such a repetitive kind of way text dependent questions, the same graphic organizers over and over- it gets boring and it doesn't provide multiple ways for them to share information.",

They help to inform your lessons and give a clear guide of where to go with your students.The reading and writing units are complementary, though if you get further ahead in the reading, you may not have finished something in the writing that you need.It's very important for teachers to know that Lucy Calkins says that you shouldn't do centers.This said, many people use the lessons but also do centers.It is also important to know that the lesson plans are very in-depth and take a long time to read through each lesson.For some lessons, you have to gather or create materials (like stories) or plan for experiments. Since it was written with the NY public schools in mind, it has some science experiments (in the writing unit) that may align with the NY standards.I do it during writing time, but the experiments in the unit aren't from the science units we teach in BPS.",

Some of them could be used as Social Studies or Science Materials to supplement the Science or Social Studies curriculum that teachers are using.EL Modules are great for students who need a challenge or for students working on or above grade level.The Modules are no support for struggling readers.The Modules take up so much of the ELA Block daily, there is little or in some cases no time to teach the skills and strategies students need when learning to read.According to textbooks students above 3rd grade should be reading to learn but the reality is that many of our students are struggling readers or nonreaders in 5th grade, and until we teach them to read, they will always struggle.We have to teach them to read before we can expect them to read to learn.Some where there is a break down in our system when it comes to teaching students to read. Using EL Modules as the main reading curriculum is not the answer to our struggling readers.",

To me, it seems like a waste of time.Also, it doesn't really teach greater number sense, it just assesses whether or not you already have it.",

It assumes that students can take home a chapter book, read a chapter or two, and come prepared to discuss it the next day (this describes very few of our students here at the Umana.) Engage NY is not designed to support students who are learning English as a second language nor is it designed to adequately support the needs of a Dual Language program. Engage NY assumes your ELA block is roughly 2 hours per day and that you are not teaching other things like guided reading centers. At the Umana, students in the DL program only receive 1 block (50 minutes less transition time) of ELA per day. This means teachers have to fit close reading, guided reading centers, and writing into about 45 minutes (at best). When being told to use Engage with this time limit, we have to make 10 hours of instruction fit into about 90 minutes per week. Everything we do has to be adjusted or supplemented to better serve students who are ELLs (this described more than 85% of our school) as well as students who are reading below grade level. Engage NY does not differentiate worksheets, activities, or reading passages. Additionally, it does not provide practice that is aligned to MCAS (like Part A and Part B question sets).",
